PORTAGE(5)                          Portage                         PORTAGE(5)



[1mNAME[0m
       portage - the heart of Gentoo

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       The  current portage code uses many different configuration files, most
       of which are unknown to users and normal developers.  Here we will  try
       to  collect  all the odds and ends so as to help users more effectively
       utilize portage.  This is a reference  only  for  files  which  do  not
       already have a man page.

       All  files in the make.profile directory may be tweaked via parent pro‐
       files when  using  cascading  profiles.   For  more  info,  please  see
       http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/releng/docs/cascading-profiles.xml

       Note:  If  you  are looking for information on how to emerge something,
              please see [1memerge[22m(1).

[1mGLOSSARY[0m
       In the following sections, some terminology may be foreign  to  you  or
       used  with meaning specific to Portage.  Please see the referenced man‐
       pages for more detailed explanations.

              [1mDEPEND atom[0m
                     An atom is either of the form  category/package  or  con‐
                     sists  of  an  operator followed by category/package fol‐
                     lowed by a hyphen and a version specification.   An  atom
                     might be suffixed by a slot specification.

                            category/package, where the special  '*'  wildcard

                            normal characters. More than one '*' character  is
                            allowed, but not two next to each other.

                     The    global   custom   settings   for   Portage.    See
                     [1mmake.conf[22m(5).

              This is usually  just  a  symlink  to  the  correct  profile  in
              [1m/usr/portage/profiles/[22m.   Since  it is part of the portage tree,
              it may easily be updated/regenerated by running `emerge --sync`.
              It  defines what a profile is (usually arch specific stuff).  If
              you need a  custom  profile,  then  you  should  make  your  own
              [1m/etc/make.profile/  [22mdirectory  and populate it.  However, if you
              just wish to override some settings,  use  [1m/etc/portage/profile/[0m
              (it  supports all of the same file types that [1m/etc/make.profile/[0m
              does, except parent). Do NOT edit the settings in [1m/etc/make.pro‐[0m
              [1mfile/  [22mbecause  they WILL be lost with the next `emerge --sync`.
              If both [1m/etc/make.profile/ [22mand [1m/etc/portage/make.profile/ [22mexist,
              then [1m/etc/make.profile/ [22mwill be preferred.

              Any  file  in  this  directory, directories of other profiles or
              top-level "profiles" directory that begins  with  "package."  or
              "use." can be more than just a flat file.  If it is a directory,
              then all the files in that directory will be sorted in ascending
              alphabetical  order  by  file  name and summed together as if it
              were a single file. Note that this behavior  is  only  supported
              since  portage-2.1.6.7,  and  it  is not included in PMS at this
              time.

                     For example, if you manage your own copy of a 2.6 kernel,
                     then you can tell portage  that  'sys-kernel/development-
                     sources-2.6.7' is already taken care of and it should get
                     off your back about it.

                     Portage will not attempt to  update  a  package  that  is
                     listed  here unless another package explicitly requires a

              This  directory  is  used to store internal portage cache files.
              The names and purpose of these files are not documented on  pur‐
              pose  so  as  to  keep  down bitrot as internals change.  If you
              aren't working on portage  internally,  then  the  details  most
              likely do not matter to you.

              This  entire directory can be safely deleted.  It is highly rec‐
              ommended you do not do this however as it can be a time  consum‐
              ing process to generate them all again.

       [1m/var/db/pkg/[0m
              All  installed package information is recorded here.  If portage
              thinks you have a package installed, it is usually because it is
              listed here.

              The  format  follows  somewhat closely that of the portage tree.
              There is a directory for each  category  and  a  package-version
              subdirectory for each package you have installed.

              Inside  each  package directory are misc files that describe the
              installed contents of the package as well as build time informa‐
              tion  (so  that  the package can be unmerged without needing the
              portage tree).

              The exact file contents and format are not described here  again
              so  that  things can be changed quickly.  Generally though there
              is one  file  per  environment  variable  that  "matters"  (like
              CFLAGS)  with  the contents stored inside of it.  Another common
              file is the CONTENTS file which lists the path and hashes of all
              objects that the package installed onto your system.

                     Note  that this does not mean that the packages that were
                     installed as dependencies are listed here.  For  example,
                     if  you  run `emerge mod_wsgi` and you do not have apache
